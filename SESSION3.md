# Session 3

## Topics for Today

- __Important__: Next week we start at 18:00 and finish at 20:30 (sharp!)
- Reminder to join the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/tkvjkEwR) to share tips and info

### Project Support

- The next two weeks are all about completing and supporting your projects
- The aim is to order your PCB from JLCPCB during next week's session!

- Quick poll: who is working on what?

	- WeevilEye Bug Blinky

### Revisiting our [layer palette](https://morepcb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/PCB-Surface-Finishing-Structure-1.png) (and a correction from last week!)

Elements of the layer palette:

	1. PCB substrate (the raw board, in our case FR4)
	2. Copper (optional)
	3. Solder mask (optional)
		- Remember that the solder mask layer is subtractive (there by default unless you remove it)
		- If you draw on the solder mask layer...
			- ...and there's no copper underneath: you will see the raw board
			- ...and there is copper underneath: it will get covered surface finish (more below!)
		- Solder mask over copper looks darker compared to over raw board
	4. Silkscreen ink (optional)
		- Can only be on top of solder mask, not the raw board or plated copper areas

### All about [surface finishes](https://morepcb.com/pcb-surface-finishes/)

- Surface finishes coat any exposed copper areas
- Correction from last week: exposed copper is not allowed!
- They are applied (towards the end of the production process](https://youtu.be/jTBOSob5MLg?feature=shared&t=2804)
- They prevent corrosion and aid component soldering
- Traces are usually covered with mask and pads are usually left exposed

#### Main Types
- The two main types of surface finish are [HASL and ENIG](https://www.globalwellpcba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Comparison-of-HASL-vs.-ENIG-surface-finishes-on-PCBs.webp) and have 
- HASL: Hot Air Solder Leveling
	- Silver look, cheaper, somewhat even, good for hand soldering
- ENIG: Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold
	- Gold bling look, more expensive, flatter and more uniform
- And there are more...

### Design examples 

See if you can identify what the different palette elements are in the following designs:

### Planes and pours and their usage

- Planes: for power, ground, or artistic purposes
- Electrical benefits of planes are that they:
	- Provide low-impedance paths for return currents
	- Enable robust power distribution across the board
	- Aid thermal management preventing hot spots and acting as heat sinks
	- Reduce noise and electromagnetic interference
	- Improve signal integrity (critical in high-speed or mixed-signal)
- You can still route traces on the the same copper layer as a plane!
