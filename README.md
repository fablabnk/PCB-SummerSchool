This is a repo to support our [_Maker Summer School: Printed Circuit Board Design_](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/maker-summer-school-printed-circuit-board-design-tickets-1604544318249) series of events 

- Reminder to join the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/XeFhvPQ43z) to share tips and info

## About the Event Series

- It's a continuation of our FOSS series on open-source tools for fabrication
- (Last time we learned FreeCAD together)
- Today is a general intro, to see if PCB design is your thing
- If it is, join the "learning pact" for the next 3 weeks to complete/design/send for your own board

## The Basics

Over four evening sessions, FabLab NK Manager Graham will take you on a gentle dive into the typically hidden-world of everyday electronics and help you start to make your own. All courses will be led in English. From LED ‘blinkies’, to synthesisers, mini-games consoles, keyboards and even PCB jewelry, we will take a look at a series of example projects that we’ve produced in the lab over the last year and use those as learning tools and jumping-off points for your own designs.

Modern printed circuit board design is an art form that brings together engineering and artistic perspectives. Using the high-precision manufacturing capabilities of fabrication houses, you can treat a board as your canvas utilising techniques such as masking, silkscreening, copper pours and drilling as your paint palette, allowing you to produce highly original and cost-effective individual designs.

And of course we’ll learn some electronics too as a side effect :)

All session takes place from 18:30, apart from the last session on 1/10 which starts earlier at 18:00
